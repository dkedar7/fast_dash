# Under the hood

Different configurations that go into building a Fast Dash app determine the UI components, themes, how the app is deployed and the nature of user interaction.

The intention of this document is to introduce all those options so that you can make the most of Fast Dash.

## Building your Fast Dash app
There are two ways to build a Fast Dash app:

1. Decorating Python functions with the `@fastdash` decorator

``` py hl_lines="3"
from fast_dash import fastdash

@fastdash(...)
def your_function(...):
    ...
```
2. Instantiating an object of the `FastDash` class

``` py hl_lines="6 7"
from fast_dash import FastDash

def your_function(...):
    ...

app = FastDash(callback_fn=your_function, ...)
app.run()
```

Using the `@fastdash` decorator is the quickest way to deploy Fast Dash apps but the `FastDash` class gives us access to the other Fast Dash internals and allows us to tweak them as you see fit.

Whereas the `fastdash` decorator deploys our app at the time of defining our functions, the `FastDash` class objects are equivalent to Flask's server objects, which
allow us to deploy our app later. But we'll understand these difference better throughout the remainder of this document.

!!! note
    Both the `@fastdash` decorator and the `FastDash` class objects are functionally equivalent. The `@fastdash` decorator is internally powered by the `FastDash` class. Using decorators saves us the need to specify callback functions as the first argument when defining the `FastDash` object.


Let's first understand how to build Fast Dash apps using the `@fastdash` decorator and then extend these ideas to the `FastDash` class.

### 1. `@fastdash` decorator

#### What's a decorator?

In a nutshell, Python decorators are function wrappers that enrich the functionaltiy of Python functions. [Here's](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/) an in-depth write-up on Python decorators, what they are and how to build them. But all that we need to know for now is that decorators, themselves, are Python functions which take other functions as arguments and add extra functionality to them.

The `@fastdash` decorator is also just a function (read more here about the implementation in the [Modules](../api.md) section) that takes the callback function as the first argument and designs a web app around it. But instead of explicitly specifying the name of the callback function as the first argument, we use this syntax instead:

```py
@fastdash(...)
def your_function(...)
    ...
```

#### How to use `@fastdash`

After we have a Python function that runs without errors, there are only two things we need to do:

##### 1. Specify the input and output type hints
Fast Dash uses these type hints to determine which components to use. For example, an input with the type hint `int` will need an input that allows entering integers or a slider. Similarly, an image input will need an upload image or a camera component.

!!! question "What are type hints?"
    First introduced in Python 3.5, __type hints__ are mainly meant to be used IDEs and linters to raise data type mismatch warnings. They not executed during runtime and any errors with type hinting doesn't affect the execution of the function itself. Read more about Python type hints [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html).

    ```py
    def your_function(a: str, b: int, c: list) -> str:
        ...
    ```

    Fast Dash uses this flexbility with defining type hints to also using Fast Components as hints. More on this in the documentation for [Fast Components](components.md).

So far, Fast Dash understands two types of type hintsâ€”one, Python in-built data type classes (`str`, `int`, `float`, `list`, `dict`, etc.), and two, [Fast Components](components.md).

In addition to type hints, the input arguments can also have default values. In the example below, the default values of integer `a` is `Fast`, that of `b` is `5` and `c` is a `list` with a default value of `[1, 2, 3]`.

```py hl_lines="1"
def your_function(a: str = "Fast", b: int = 5, c: list = [1, 2, 3]) -> str:
    ...
```

Fast Dash determines the best [Fast Components](components.md) to use for each input from their hints and default values. Details about which combination of these values result into what components are in the [patterns documentation](patterns.md).

[Fast Components](components.md) are also valid type hints for Fast Dash. Instead of depending on the hints and default values, using [Fast Components](components.md) is a direct way of telling Fast Dash which components to use. In the example below, `UploadImage` and `Slider` are in-built Fast Component wrappers for [`dcc.Upload`](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-core-components/upload) and [`dcc.Slider`](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-core-components/slider) respectively. The function returns a text field, represented using the [`html.H1`](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-html-components/h1) component by default.

```py hl_lines="1 4"
from fast_dash import fastdash, UploadImage, Slider

@fastdash
def your_function(image: UploadImage, number: Slider):
    ...
```

##### 2. Modify default settings (if required, optional)

These include multiple options like the theme of the app, social media branding links, and subheaders.

###### Title

Fast Dash is able to read the title of our callback function and display it at the top of the app. Titles resolve the best if the function name is written in [snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case).

For example, `your_function` resolves to `Your Function` but `yourFunction` will resolve to `YourFunction`. For such cases, we can manually specify the title as an argument to `@fastdash`.

```py hl_lines="1"
@fastdash(title="Your Function")
def yourFunction(...):
    ...
```

###### Subheader

The subheader shows up below the title at the top of the page in an italicized font. Fast Dash also attempts to infer this from the function docstring. But we can also overwrite this in the `subheader` argument to `@fastdash`.

```py hl_lines="2"
@fastdash(title="Your Function", 
          subheader="Coolest Function Ever")
def yourFunction(...):
    ...
```
