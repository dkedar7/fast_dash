This document outlines some common Fast Dash patterns and how you can use these ideas to fastrack your deployment.

## 1. User input options and components

By changing the callback function type hints, their default values, Dash components, and in-built Fast components, you can display most common input components for users to enter their inputs.

| Use case  | Type hint | Default value | Example   |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
|           |           |               |           |
|           |           |               |           |
|           |           |               |           |
