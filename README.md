Fast Dash is a Python module that makes the development of web applications fast and easy. It is built on top of Plotly Dash and can be used to build web interfaces for Machine Learning models or to showcase any proof of concept without the hassle of developing UI from scratch.

## Simple example

With Fast Dash's decorator `fastdash`, it's a breeze to deploy any Python function as a web app. Here's how to use it to write your first Fast Dash app:
```python
from fast_dash import fastdash

@fastdash
def text_to_text_function(input_text):
    return input_text

# * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

And just like that (ðŸª„), we have a completely functional interactive app!

Output:

---

Fast Dash can read additional details about a function, like its name, input and output types, docstring, and uses this information to infer which components to use.

For example, here's how to deploy an app that takes a string and an integer as inputs and return some text.

```python
from fast_dash import fastdash

@fastdash
def display_selected_text_and_number(text: str, number: int) -> str:
    "Simply display the selected text and number"
    processed_text = f'Selected text is {text} and the number is {number}.'
    return processed_text

# * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
Output:

And with just a few more lines, we can add a title icon, subheader and other social branding details.

```python
from fast_dash import fastdash

@fastdash(title_image_path='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dkedar7/fast_dash/main/docs/assets/favicon.jpg',
        github_url='https://github.com/dkedar7/fast_dash',
        linkedin_url='https://linkedin.com/in/dkedar7',
        twitter_url='https://twitter.com/dkedar')
def display_selected_text_and_number(text: str, number: int) -> str:
    "Simply display the selected text and number"
    processed_text = f'Selected text is {text} and the number is {number}.'
    return processed_text
```

Output:

## Community

Fast Dash is built on open-source. You are encouraged to share your own projects, which will be highlighted on a common community gallery (coming up).

## Credits

Fast Dash is built using [Plotly Dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash). Dash's Flask-based backend enables Fast Dash apps to scale easily and makes them highly compatibility with other integration services. This project is partially inspired from [gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio).

The project template was created with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) and [zillionare/cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/zillionare/cookiecutter-pypackage).
